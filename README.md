# 🌌 VOID-OS

**The Ultimate Cinematic Terminal Lock-Screen**

VOID-OS is a cinematic and psychological terminal experience that blurs the line between a security tool and a theatrical performance.

This project is built for network engineers, curious minds, and those who enjoy playing mind games through the terminal.

## ⚠️ Important Warning

VOID-OS is **strictly a prank tool**.

It does NOT delete any of your system data and only removes **its own code** if the final scenario is triggered.
However, it is intentionally designed to create high levels of stress and psychological pressure.

Use responsibly.

## 🧠 The Cynic AI

The Cynic is an ASCII-based artificial intelligence that monitors all of your inputs and deliberately tries to make you fail.

System behavior changes based on how many mistakes you make:

| Level     | Behavior                                           |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| I – III   | Mockery, sarcasm, and mild text shaking            |
| IV – VIII | Heavy terminal shaking, corrupted output, glitches |
| IX – XI   | Targets sensitive directories (ssh, crypto, projects) |
| XII       | Scorched Earth Protocol activation                 |

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

### 🧩 Handshake Protocol

To unlock the system, you must manually complete a **TCP Three-Way Handshake**.

This section is a logic puzzle and requires a correct understanding of message order and sequence number incrementation.

Steps:

* **SYN** – Connection request
* **SYN-ACK** – Server response (The Cynic’s trap)
* **ACK** – Connection finalization

### 🌪️ Simulated Liquidation

After 12 registered errors, the final scenario is executed:

* Simulation of sensitive file deletion
* Self-destruction of the program
* Disabling control keys such as Ctrl+C

At this stage, you are only an observer.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher
* A terminal with ANSI color support (Windows Terminal, iTerm2, etc.)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashi-fbx/VoidOS.git
