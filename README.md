🌌 VOID-OS 🌌

The Ultimate Cinematic Terminal Lock-Screen

VoidOS is a psychological terminal experience that blurs the line between a security tool and a theatrical performance.

Designed for network engineers, pranksters, and those who dare to enter the void.

⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING

[!CAUTION]
VOID-OS IS A PRANK TOOL. It features high-fidelity simulations of system-level data destruction. While it does not delete actual user data (only its own source code), it is designed to induce high stress. Use it responsibly.

🧠 THE CYNIC AI

Meet your new judge. The Cynic is a reactive ASCII consciousness that monitors your every keystroke. It doesn't want you to succeed.

Level

State

System Behavior

I - III

😒 Mocking

Sarcastic comments and slight text flickering.

IV - VIII

😡 Aggravated

Terminal jitter, corrupted stdout streams, and glitches.

IX - XI

☣️ Hostile

"Targeting" sensitive directories (.ssh, crypto, projects).

XII

☢️ NUCLEAR

Protocol 'Scorched Earth' initiated.

⚙️ CORE MECHANICS

🧩 The Handshake Protocol

To unlock the system, you must manually complete a TCP 3-Way Handshake. This isn't just typing; it's a logic puzzle involving sequence increments ($Seq + 1$).

SYN: Connection request initiated.

SYN-ACK: Server synchronization (The Cynic's trap).

ACK: Finalizing the handshake.

🌪️ Simulated Liquidation

Once the 12th failure is registered, the "Scorched Earth" routine begins:

Visual Wipe: High-speed logs showing the "deletion" of your most sensitive files.

Self-Erasure: The program utilizes self-deletion logic to remove its own traces.

Input Hijack: Standard interrupts (Ctrl+C) are disabled. You are a spectator to the void.
